      question: "How does Athena work?",
      answer: "Athena matches you with a top-tier full-time executive assistant who has been rigorously vetted for their skills, communication abilities, and problem-solving capabilities. Your assistant undergoes comprehensive training on delegation and leverages AI tools to maximize their efficiency, allowing you to delegate tasks more effectively.",
      category: "Getting Started"
    },
    {
      question: "What types of tasks can I delegate to my Athena assistant?",
      answer: "Your Athena assistant can handle a wide range of tasks including email management, calendar scheduling, travel arrangements, research, data entry, basic graphic design, social media management, expense reporting, meeting preparation, and much more. As your assistant becomes more familiar with your preferences and processes, they can take on increasingly complex responsibilities.",
      category: "Services"
    },
    {
      question: "How much does an Athena assistant cost?",
      answer: "Athena assistants are available for $3,000 per month. This flat fee covers a full-time (40+ hours/week) dedicated assistant, complete training, AI tool access, and ongoing performance monitoring. There are no hidden fees, contracts, or complicated pricing tiers.",
      category: "Pricing"
    },
    {
      question: "What makes Athena assistants different from other VA services?",
      answer: "Athena stands apart through our rigorous vetting process (less than 1% acceptance rate), comprehensive delegation training, and proprietary AI enhancement tools. Unlike other services that offer fractional assistants, Athena provides you with a dedicated full-time professional who becomes a true extension of your team. We focus exclusively on securing elite talent rather than offering tiered service levels with varying quality.",
      category: "Comparison"
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can I get started with an assistant?",
      answer: "Most clients are matched with their Athena assistant within 1-2 weeks of signing up. Our team works diligently to understand your specific needs and preferences to ensure an optimal match. Once matched, you can begin delegating tasks immediately while our onboarding team helps facilitate a smooth transition.",
      category: "Getting Started"
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel my Athena subscription?",
      answer: "Yes, you can cancel your Athena subscription at any time with no long-term contracts or commitments. We're confident in the value our assistants provide and don't believe in locking clients into agreements. If you need to cancel, simply let us know with 30 days' notice.",
