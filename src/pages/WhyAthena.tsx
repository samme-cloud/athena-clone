              Hi, this is Robert and Jonathan, co-founders of Athena. Over the last decade, we've helped build <CompanyLink href="#">Thumbtack</CompanyLink> and <CompanyLink href="#">TaskUs</CompanyLink> to teams of 25,000 people and $6B in marketplace volume.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having been through every stage of a startup, we can tell you that the people who appear most successful are the ones best at leveraging the talents of an extraordinary team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Athena is yours.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our secret weapon in growing companies was developing a deep partnership with Jam and Marni, our Executive Assistants. They don't just save us time; they gives us massive leverage. They help recruit talent, manage our inboxes, build deeper relationships with friends, hit our work and personal goals. In short, our assistants help us win â€“ both work and life.
            </p>

                <strong className="text-white">Recruiting:</strong> We have interviewed over 500,000 assistants from around the world and have developed a best in class recruiting process and matching algorithm. We find people with raw potential rather than people who simply have experience. We source assistants who are excited to build a long-term relationship, and we only want clients who are equally long-term focused.
